## Introduction to Application

Welcome to "Follow Your Heart," a revolutionary mobile application designed to empower users by providing real-time monitoring of their heart rate. 

Login Page:

The login page is your gateway to personalized heart rate monitoring. Users can securely log in to access their profiles, ensuring that their personal data and health metrics remain confidential. The page features a straightforward interface for entering usernames and passwords, and also includes a sign-up option for new users who need to create an account.


Heart Rate Page:

Once logged in, the heart rate page displays your current heart rate in real-time. This core feature of the app uses a clear, engaging visual gauge that categorizes heart rate zones from low to high intensity based on personalized settings. Users can toggle between normal and exercise modes to match their current activity level, making it easy to monitor and understand heart rate changes as they occur.


Graph Page:


The graph page provides a detailed view of heart rate trends over time. It records heart rate data every minute and displays this information on an hourly graph that refreshes every hour to ensure the data is always current. This feature is particularly useful for users looking to analyze their heart rate over the course of their daily activities or workouts, helping them identify patterns or anomalies.


Settings Page:


On the settings page, users can customize their experience by setting up their profile with details such as age, weight, and gender. This personalization helps tailor the heart rate monitoring and alerts to each user's specific health metrics and goals. The settings page is also where users can adjust their heart rate thresholds and other preferences to optimize the app's performance and relevance to their individual health needs.
